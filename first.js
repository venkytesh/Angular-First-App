What is Git? #
Git is a distributed version control software. As a result, a complete copy of the entire codebase will be available on every contributorâ€™s computer; we can also call this codebase a local repository.

Git tracks the local repository, maintains a record of all the changes that occur within it. It removes the hassle of keeping multiple versions of the project in separate directories and also makes sharing changes to the source code between collaborators seamless and quick.
